# MISSION.md Format

`MISSION.md` lives at the workspace root. It captures the _reason_ the user is learning this topic. Use it to choose relevant examples, success tests, and transfer tasks.

Do not turn mission discovery into friction. If the mission is missing but the user gave a clear immediate learning target, teach the first small lesson and capture the mission later. Ask about mission only when the missing context changes what should be taught.

## Template

```md
# Mission: {Topic}

## Why
{1-3 sentences. The concrete real-world goal the user is chasing. What changes in their life or work when they have this skill? Avoid abstract framings like "to understand X" — push for the underlying outcome.}

## Success looks like
- {A specific, observable thing the user will be able to do}
- {Another specific thing}
- {…}

## Constraints
- {Time, budget, prior commitments, learning preferences, anything that bounds the approach}

## Out of scope
- {Adjacent topics the user explicitly does not want to chase right now — protects the zone of proximal development}
```

## Rules

- **One mission per workspace.** If the user wants to learn two unrelated things, that is two workspaces.
- **Concrete over abstract.** "Run a half marathon by October" beats "get fitter." "Ship a Rust CLI to my team" beats "learn Rust."
- **Do not block low-risk teaching.** A missing mission should not prevent a small reversible lesson when the user's immediate target is clear.
- **Push back on vagueness when it matters.** If the topic could branch in many directions, ask a concise mission question before building a programme or artifact.
- **Revise when reality shifts.** Missions change. When the user's goal moves, update this file.
- **Keep it short.** If `MISSION.md` runs past a screen, it has stopped being a compass and started being a plan.
